Hi there, this is krish Jaiswal and today we are going to make our first ever cake.But Virtually.
This is because I am selfish and wont let out my cake to anyone...Well that actually depends on your Operating System. If your OS allows to have a cake virtually, then no worries...Lets have it.
LEts now see how to cook it.
